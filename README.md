What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
I would design the whole site before implementation.

Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
I always struggle with design. I don't think it will change for future projects.

What would you add to or change about your application if given more time?
I would redesign the site, add some styling, and make pagination work.
